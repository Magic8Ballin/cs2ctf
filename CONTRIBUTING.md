# Contributing
Hey there! Thanks for wanting to be part of CS2 CTF. We try to replicate one of the oldest game modes to be one of the most competitive ones in Counter Strike. We appreciate everybody who wants to support and help.

## Bug Reports
Either open a new issue here on GitHub or create a new report on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Xwp5eun7w7)

## Translations
Open up a new PR with your corresponding language file and we will merge it ASAP!

## Bug Fixes
Feel free to PR your changes! We appreciate any help we can get to make this one of the most vanilla-feeling and competitive gamemodes in Counter Strike!

## New Features
If you want to PR new features, please make sure that your feature is disabled by default and flagged behind a convar for everybody to enable if they want to. If you believe that your feature is somewhat a core gameplay mechanic and needs to be enabled from start on, lets have a talk on Discord or in the PR. Also keep in mind that the feature should be generally designed in a way it benefits the community, if it an extremely opinionated feature for only a small subset of users we may close it.

## Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability within our code, please contact the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Xwp5eun7w7)!
